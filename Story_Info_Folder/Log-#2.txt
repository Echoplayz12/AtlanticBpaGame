		"We have begun to call the first test subjects' evolved species Charybdis due to them no longer being able to them being classified as the same species they was were
		 anymore. The Charybdis' have been most useful in pushing back the tide, their ability to intake vast quantities of water have allowed us to retake half of the 
		 districts we had lost. Our discovery of Nektarios was truly a blessing from the gods, the substance is truly divine. We have also began to use the Charybdis to carve
		 out the caves under the city to provide us with more materials and space. Some of the other expiriments have begun to show changes now though there is nothing notable
		 yet with unusual abilities that may benefit Atlantis"
